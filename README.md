# Spot-Hackaton-UI
Try to build a simple site supported by an API using the technology that you like. 
We will review the results to discuss pros/cons and try to find a better way of develop website of our service

## Tasks
- Build a website with at least two pages:
  - Search results list 
  - Single result specific page
- The data should come from an API:
  - OLS api
  - BioSamples v4 api
- Put your project in a separate folder `<name> - <technology>`
- Try to give a brief description of your project in a Readme.md file
- If you like you can try multiple technologies
  - If you try more than 2 techonologis, think about create a base folder with your name and divide each project in a subfolder


## Assessment
We need to understand pro/cons of each technology based on your experience. Try to reason about the next topic:
- How much readable is your code?
- Your technology let you build a template/boilerplate you can easily reuse in other projects?
- Can you build components with your technology?
  - Are these components reusable in other projects?
  - Are the component coupled with your technology?
  - Are your component customizable (style, functionality, both)
- Is your technology easy to use?
  - What was your experience?
  - Is the documentation easy to understand?
  - Is the technology well supported?
  - How easy is to find resources about the technology?

## Outcome
- Should we switch paradigm from a monolith application to an API supported website?
- Should we pick one technology and use that in all our projects or is better to decide on a base to base case?
